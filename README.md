# WebMovieTrivia
The movie night trivia mobile site needs to allow two players to play against each other on separate devices. Once connected, the players are each presented with a random movie title from IMDBâ€™s top 250 list and asked to guess the year it was released. A game consists of 8 rounds with 5 points allocated for a correct answer and -3 for an incorrect answer. The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.
The game needs to be real-time and rely on a RESTful API which scrapes the movie data from http://www.imdb.com/chart/top?ref_=nb_mv_3_chttp .
The following technologies are used: HTML5, Javascript, CSS3.
Extra input added - responsive UI, angular.js, node and innovation/creativity.
